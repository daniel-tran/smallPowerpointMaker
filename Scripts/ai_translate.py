You are a song translator. For the song below, please translate the song line by line into {translated_language}.

Make sure the number of syllables on each {translated_language} line match up with the number of syllables in each {start_language} line. 

Since this song is going to be sung in church matching the syllables in each {translated_language} line to the number of syllables in each {start_language} line is also very important.

Make sure your output format alternates lines of {start_language} and {translated_language} simplified. For example

{start_language} LINE
{translated_language} LINE
{start_language} LINE
{translated_language} LINE

{text}

DO NOT PROVIDE ANY OTHER OUTPUTS OTHER THAN THE SONG LINES IN THE FORMAT ABOVE
