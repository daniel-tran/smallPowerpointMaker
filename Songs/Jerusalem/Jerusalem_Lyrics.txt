Jerusalem
CCLI license number: 23847389
[Verse 1]
See Him in Jerusalem
Walking where the crowds are
Once these streets had sung to Him
Now they cry for murder
Such a frail and lonely man
Holding up the heavy cross
See Him walking in Jerusalem
On the road to save us
[Verse 2]
See him there upon the hill
Hear the scorn and laughter
Silent as a lamb he waits
Praying to the father
[Verse 2]
See the king who made the sun
And the moon and shining stars
Let the soldiers hold and nail him down
So that he could save them
[Verse 3]
See him there upon the cross
Now no longer breathing
Dust that formed the watching crowds
Takes the blood of Jesus
[Verse 3]
Feel the earth is shaking now
See the veil is split in two
And he stood before the wrath of God
Shielding sinners with his blood
[Verse 4]
See the empty tomb today
Death could not contain him
Once the servant of the world
Now in victory reigning
[Verse 4]
Lift your voices to the one
Who is seated on the throne
See him in the new Jerusalem
Praise the one who saved us (x2)
