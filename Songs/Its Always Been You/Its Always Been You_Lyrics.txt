It’s Always Been You
CCLI license number: 96299363
[Verse 1]
You saw me first
You let me in when I was at my worst
The moment when I heard You say my name
[Verse 1]
It's the first time in so long I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
[Chorus]
You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time, my guardian was You
[Chorus]
You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past, You'll be there tomorrow
All my life, Your love was breaking through
[Post-Chorus]
It's always been You
It's always been You
[Verse 2]
My northern star
Your love will be the compass of my heart
Oh, I just wanna be right wherе You are
Right where You arе
[Chorus]
And You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time, my guardian was You

And You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past, You'll be there tomorrow
All my life, Your love was breaking through
[Post-Chorus]
It's always been You
It's always been You
It's always been You
It's always been You
[Bridge]
Who stood with me in the fire?
It was You, it was always You
Who pulled me out of the water?
It was You, it was always You
Who carried me on Their shoulders?
It was You, I know it's You
[Chorus]
You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time, my guardian was You

You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past, You'll be there tomorrow
All my life, Your love was breaking through
[Post-Chorus]
It's always been You
It's always been You
It's always been You
It's always been You
[Outro]
It's always been You
