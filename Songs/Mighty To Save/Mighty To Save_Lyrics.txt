[Verse 1]
Everyone needs compassion
A love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me

Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour
The hope of nations
[Chorus]
Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save

Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave
[Verse 2]
So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
And fill my life again

I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender
[Chorus]
Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save

Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save

Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave
[Bridge]
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King
[Chorus]
Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save

Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save

Forever, Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave
[Outro]
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus
Shine your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King
