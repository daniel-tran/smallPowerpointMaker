On That Day
CCLI license number: 38293725
[Verse 1]
I believe in Christ, risen from the dead
He now reigns victorious, His kingdom knows no end
Through His resurrection, death has lost its hold
I know on that final day, I'll rise as Jesus rose
[Chorus]
On that day, we will see You
Shining brighter than the sun
On that day, we will know You
As we lift our voice as one
'Til that day, we will praise You
For Your never-ending grace
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day
[Verse 2]
What a blessed hope, though now tired and worn
We will spend eternity around our Saviour's throne
Though we grieve our losses, we grieve not in vain
For we know our crown of glory waits beyond the grave
[Chorus]
On that day, we will see You
Shining brighter than the sun
On that day, we will know You
As we lift our voice as one
'Til that day, we will praise You
For Your never-ending grace
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day
[Bridge]
Hallelujah, what a day it will be!
For at home with You, my joy is complete
As I run into Your arms open wide, I will see
My Father who is waiting for me (x2)
My Father who is waiting for me
[Chorus]
On that day, we will see You
Shining brighter than the sun
On that day, we will know You
As we lift our voice as one
'Til that day, we will praise You
For Your never ending-grace
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day
[Chorus]
On that day, we will see You
Shining brighter than the sun
On that day, we will know You
As we lift our voice as one
'Til that day, we will praise You
For Your never-ending grace
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day
