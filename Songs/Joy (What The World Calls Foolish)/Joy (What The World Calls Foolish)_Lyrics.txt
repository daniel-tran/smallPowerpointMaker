Joy (What The World Calls Foolish)
CCLI license number: 37628372
[Chorus]
I've got joy in the morning
Joy in the evening
You keep me dancing
In every season
Whatever comes tomorrow
I've got joy
[Verse 1]
Why would I not sing of Your praises?
Even when troubles come
Why would I not worship forever
'Cause I've seen the good You've done
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not ashamed, I'm a sinner saved
No, I'm not afraid anymore
What the world calls foolish, You call freedom
No, I won't hold back anymore
[Chorus]
I've got joy in the morning
Joy in the evening
You keep me dancing
In every season
Whatever comes tomorrow
I've got joy
[Verse 2]
I'm letting go, I'm wild in Your presence,
Dance till the sun comes up
You make me strong whenever I praise You
Jesus, You fill my cup
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not ashamed, I'm a sinner saved
No, I'm not afraid anymore
What the world calls foolish, You call freedom
No, I won't hold back anymore
[Chorus]
I've got joy in the morning
Joy in the evening
You keep me dancing
In every season
Whatever comes tomorrow
I've got joy
[Chorus 2]
I've got joy in the sunshine
Joy in the rain
You keep me dancing again and again
Whatever comes tomorrow
I've got joy
[Bridge 1]
I got joy, joy, joy down in my heart
I got joy, joy, joy down in my heart
I got joy, joy, joy down in my heart
Hallelujah (x2)
