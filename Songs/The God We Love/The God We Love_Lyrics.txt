The God We Love (Nicene Creed) [Live]
CCLI license number: 29941028
[Verse 1]
We believe in one God, the Father
The Almighty, the Maker of all
The One who rules the seen and unseen
We believe and we adore
Jesus Christ, one Lord of creation
From the Father, begotten not made
He is the Light from Light eternal
And the God of every age
[Chorus]
All glory to the Father now
All honour to the Son
And praise the Spirit now and always
This is the God wе love
[Verse 2]
For this world and for our salvation
He came down from thе heavens above
Born of a virgin and the Spirit
Truly man and truly God
He was crucified under Pilate
Suffered death and was laid in the grave
And in accordance with the scriptures
On the third, He rose again
[Chorus]
All glory to the Father now
All honour to the Son
And praise the Spirit now and always
This is the God we love
[Bridge]
And He has made His ascent
Into the heavens above
Where He sits at the Father's right hand now
But He will come back again
And He will judge in truth
The Holy Spirit has come
Voice of the prophets of God
Sent to us, He has given us new life
Forgiven now and baptised
One holy church, we rise, we rise
[Chorus]
All glory to the Father now
All honour to the Son
And praise the Spirit now and always
This is the God we love
All glory to the Father now
All honour to the Son
And praise the Spirit now and always
This is the God we love
This is the God we love


[Outro]
Now we wait to be resurrected
And we look for the world without end
This is our creed, our faith, our anthem
This is the God we love
This is the God we love
