Indescribable
CCLI license number: 34412965
[Verse 1]
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing your majesty
[Verse 1]
From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
All exclaiming
[Chorus]
Indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And you know them by name
You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable
Awestruck we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God
[Verse 2]
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
[Verse 2]
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom
[Chorus]
Indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And you know them by name
You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable
Awestruck we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God
[Outro]
Indescribable, uncontainable
You placed the stars in the sky
And you know them by name
You are amazing God
Incomparable, unchangeable
You see the depths of my heart
And you love me the same
You are amazing God
You are amazing God
