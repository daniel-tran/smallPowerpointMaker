As in Heaven, so on Earth
My heart is drawn to self-exalting
Help me seek Your kingdom first
As Jesus walked, so I shall walk
Held by Your same unchanging love
Be still my soul, O lift your voice and pray
"Father, not my will but Yours be done"
How in that Garden He persisted
I may never fully know
The fearful weight of true obedience
It was held by Him alone
What wondrous faith to bear that cross
To bear my sin, what wondrous love
My hope was sure, when therе my Saviour prayed
"Father, not my will but Yours be donе"
When I am lost, when I am broken
In the night of fear and doubt
Still, I will trust in my good Father
Yes, to one great King I bow
As Jesus rose, so I shall rise
In ransomed glory at the throne
My heart restored
With all Your saints, I sing
"Father, not my will but Yours be done"
As we go forth, our God and Father
Lead us daily in the fight
That all the world might see Your glory
And Your Name be lifted high
And in this Name we overcome
For You shall see us safely home
Now as Your church, we lift our voice and pray
"Father, not my will but Yours be done"
And in this Name we overcome
For You shall see us safely home
Now as Your church, we lift our voice and pray
"Father, not my will but Yours be done"

Father, not my will but Yours be done
Father, not my will but Yours be done
