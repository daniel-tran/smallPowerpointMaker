In Tenderness
CCLI license number: 47601513
[Verse 1]
In tenderness he sought me
Weary and sick with sin
And on His shoulders brought me
Back to His fold again
While angels in His presence sang
Until the courts of heaven rang
[Chorus]
Oh, the love that sought me!
Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold of God
Grace that brought me to the fold of God
[Verse 2]
He died for me while I was sinning
Needy and poor and blind
He whispered to assure me
"I've found thee; thou art Mine"
I never heard a sweeter voice
It made my aching heart rejoice
[Chorus]
Oh, the love that sought me!
Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold of God
Grace that brought me to the fold of God
[Bridge]
Upon His grace I'll daily ponder
And sing anew His praise
With all adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sing His praise
[Chorus]
Oh, the love that sought me!
Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold of God
Grace that brought me to the fold of God (x2)
