[Verse 1]
Here and now I'm in the fire
In above my head
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Being held under the pressure
Don't know what'll be left
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
But it's here in the ashes
I'm finding treasure
[Chorus]
He's making diamonds, diamonds
Making diamonds out of dust
He is refining and in His timing
He's making diamonds out of us
[Verse 2]
I'll surrender to the power of being crushed by love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Til the beauty that was hidden
Isn't covered up
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh it's not what I hoped for (hoped for)
It's something much better
[Chorus]
He's making diamonds, diamonds
Making diamonds out of dust
He is refining and in His timing
He's making diamonds out of us
[Bridge]
Oh the joy of the Lord
It will be my strength
When the pressure is on
He's making diamonds (x2)
Oh the joy of the Lord
It will be my strength
When the pressure is on
He's making, he's making
[Chorus]
He's making diamonds, diamonds
Making diamonds out of dust


He is refining and in His timing
He's making diamonds out of dust
He's making diamonds out of us
[Outro]
I won't be afraid to shine
I won't be afraid to shine
I won't be afraid to shine
'Cause he's making diamonds out of dust
Making diamonds out of us
