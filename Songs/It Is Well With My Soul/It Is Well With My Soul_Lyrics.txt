It Is Well With My Soul
CCLI license number: 22104088
[Verse 1]
When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, You have taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul
[Verse 2]
But Lord it's for Thee, for Thy coming we wait
The sky not the grave is our goal
Oh, trump of the angel, oh, voice of the Lord
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul
[Chorus]
It is well 
With my soul
It is well, it is well 
With my soul
It is well 
With my soul
It is well, it is well 
With my soul
[Bridge]
You are the Rock on which I stand
By Your grace, it is well
My hope is sure in Christ my Saviour
It is well with my soul
[Chorus]
It is well 
With my soul
It is well, it is well 
With my soul
[Bridge]
You are the Rock on which I stand
By Your grace, it is well
My hope is sure in Christ my Saviour
It is well with my soul (x2)
