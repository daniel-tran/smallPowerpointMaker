What An Awesome God
CCLI license number: 23847389
[Verse 1]
God is great
Give Him all the praise
Hallelujah, Name above all names

Fire in His eyes
Healing in His veins
Everywhere, His glory on display
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Take a look at those stars
He can name them all
Before His throne every knee falls

The demons have to run
The angels have to praise
Even the winds and waves obey
[Chorus]
Our God is an awesome God, 
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom, powеr and love
Our God is an awesome God (x2)
[Verse 2]
And even when I ran
He didn't run away
He came and put death back in it's place

Friday on a cross, broken for my shame
Sunday morning rose up from that grave
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Take a look at those scars on His hands and feet
He saved our souls for eternity


Worthy is the Lamb
Glory to the King
Oh, let all the saints and the angels sing
[Chorus]
Our God is an awesome God, 
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom, powеr and love
Our God is an awesome God (x2)
[Verse 3]
Eyes on the sky
There will be a day
He will come and wipe our tears away

No more fear, no more pain
No more sorrow, sin or shame
[Bridge]
The King is coming back again
A reign of love that will never end


For everything You've done
And everything You do
And everything You are
I'll sing to You
My God, You're an awesome God
You're great in all You do
I'm made to worship You
My God, You're an awesome God
(What an awesome, awesome God You are)
(No one like You, none beside You)
(God we worship You)
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
(You’re worthy, You’re worthy)
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God
(Forever we sing)
[Chorus]
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God (x2)
