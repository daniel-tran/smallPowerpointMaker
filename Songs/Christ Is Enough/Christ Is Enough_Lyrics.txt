Christ Is Enough
CCLI license number: 77547546
[Verse 1]
Christ is my reward
And all of my devotion
Now there's nothing in this world
That could ever satisfy
[Pre-Chorus]
Through every trial, my soul will sing
No turning back, Iâ€™ve been set free
[Chorus]
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need
[Verse 2]
Christ my all in all
The joy of my salvation
And this hope will never fail
Heaven is our home
[Pre-Chorus]
Through every storm, my soul will sing
Jesus is here, to God be the glory
[Chorus]
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need
[Bridge]
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
The cross before me, the world behind me
No turning back, no turning back
The cross before me, the world behind me
No turning back, no turning back
[Chorus]
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need
[Chorus 2]
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need
[Bridge]
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
