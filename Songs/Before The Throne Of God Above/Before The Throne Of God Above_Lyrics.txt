Before The Throne Of God Above
CCLI license number: 24624915
[Verse 1]
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great high priest whose name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me
[Verse 1]
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in Heaven He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart (x2)
[Verse 2]
When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin
[Verse 2]
Because a sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me (x2)
[Verse 3]
Behold Him the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless righteousness
The great unchangeable I am
The King of glory and of grace
[Verse 3]
One in Himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ, my Savior and my God (x2)
