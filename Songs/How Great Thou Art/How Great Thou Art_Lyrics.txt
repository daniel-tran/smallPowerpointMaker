How Great Thou Art
CCLI license number: 32198318
[Verse 1]
Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works Thy hands have made
And I see the stars, and I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displays
[Chorus]
Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art (x2)
[Verse 2]
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin
[Chorus]
Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art (x2)
[Verse 3]
When Christ shall come, with shouts of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, My God, how great You are!
[Chorus]
Then sings my soul
My Saviour, God, to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art (x2)
[Outro]
How great Thou art (x2)
