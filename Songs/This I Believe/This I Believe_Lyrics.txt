[Verse 1]
Our Father everlasting
The all-creating One
God Almighty

Through your Holy Spirit
Conceiving Christ the Son
Jesus our Saviour
[Chorus]
I believe in God our Father
I believe in Christ the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in One
I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the Name of Jesus
[Verse 2]
Our Judge and our Defender
Suffered and crucified
Forgiveness is in You

Descended into darkness
You rose in glorious light
Forever seated high
[Chorus]
I believe in God our Father
I believe in Christ the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in One
I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the Name of Jesus

I believe in You
I believe You rose again
I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord
(x2)
[Chorus 2]
I believe in life eternal
I believe in the virgin birth
I believe in the saints' communion
And in Your Holy Church
I believe in the resurrection
When Jesus comes again
For I believe in the Name of Jesus
[Chorus]
I believe in God our Father
I believe in Christ the Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Our God is three in One
I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the Name of Jesus
