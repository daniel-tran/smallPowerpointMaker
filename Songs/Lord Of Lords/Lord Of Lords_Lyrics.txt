[Verse 1]
Beholding Your beauty
Is all that I long for
To worship You Jesus
Is my sole desire
For this very heart
You have shaped for Your pleasure
Purposed to lift Your Name high
[Verse 2]
Here in surrender
In pure adoration
I enter Your courts
With an offering of praise
I am Your servant
Come to bring You glory
As is fit for the work of Your hands
[Chorus]
Now unto the Lamb
Who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
All of creation resounds with the song
Worship and praise Him
The Lord of lords
[Verse 3]
Spirit now living
And dwelling within me
Keep my eyes fixed
Ever on Jesus' face
Let not the things of this world
Ever sway me
I'll run 'til I finish the race
[Chorus]
Now unto the Lamb
Who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
All of eternity echoes the song
Worship and praise Him
The Lord of lords
[Bridge]
Holy Lord
You are holy
Jesus Christ
Is the Lord (x3)
[Chorus]
Now unto the Lamb
Who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
Call all the saints to join in the song
Worship and praise Him
The Lord of lords
[Outro]
Lord of lords
Lord of lords
Lord of lords
