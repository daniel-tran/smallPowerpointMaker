You Will Never Run

[Intro]
You will never run away
You're forever mine
You will never run away
You're by my side
[Verse 1]
Love wide as galaxies
Love deeper than the sea
Countless as all infinity

Love like a shooting star
Tearing apart the dark
Shining for all eternity
Shining for all eternity
[Chorus]
You will never run away
You're forever mine
You will never run away
You're by my side
You will never run away
You forever shine
You will never run away
You're by my side
[Verse 2]
Love stronger than the grave
Love rolled the stone away
Rising with endless majesty

Love takes us by the hand
Love is the wildest dance
You are the joy and fight in me
You are the joy and fight in me
[Chorus]
You will never run away
You're forever mine
You will never run away
You're by my side
You will never run away
You forever shine
You will never run away
You're by my side
[Bridge]
Hearts open wide
Hands lifted high
Over the clouds up into the blue sky
(4x)
[Chorus]
You will never run away
You're forever mine
You will never run away
You're by my side
You will never run away
You forever shine
You will never run away
You're by my side
