Whom Shall I Fear
CCLI license number: 23847389
[Verse 1]
You hear me when I call
You are my morning song
Though darkness fills the night
It cannot hide the light
Whom shall I fear?
[Verse 2]
You crush the enemy
Underneath my feet
You are my sword and shield
Though troubles linger still
Whom shall I fear?
[Chorus]
I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
The one who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
[Verse 3]
My strength is in your name
For you alone can save
You will deliver me
Yours is the victory
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
[Chorus]
I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
The one who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
[Bridge]
And nothing formed against me shall stand
You hold the whole world in your hands
I'm holding on to your promises
[Bridge]
You are faithful
You are faithful
[Bridge]
Nothing formed against me shall stand
You hold the whole world in your hands
I'm holding on to your promises
[Bridge]
You are faithful
You are faithful
You are faithful
[Chorus]
I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
The one who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
The one who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
