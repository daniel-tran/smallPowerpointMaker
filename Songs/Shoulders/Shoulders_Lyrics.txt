[Verse 1]
When confusion's my companion
And despair holds me for ransom
I will feel no fear
I know that You are near
[Verse 2]
When I'm caught deep in the valley
With chaos for my company
I'll find my comfort here
â€˜Cause I know that You are near
[Chorus]
My help comes from You
You're right here, pulling me through
[Chorus]
You carry my weakness, my sickness,
My brokenness all on Your shoulders
Your shoulders
[Chorus]
My help comes from You
You are my rest, my rescue
[Chorus]
I don't have to see to believe that 
You're lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders
[Verse 3]
You mend what once was shattered
And You turn my tears to laughter
Your forgiveness is my fortress
Oh Your mercy is relentless
[Chorus]
My help comes from You
You're right here, pulling me through
[Chorus]
You carry my weakness, my sickness,
My brokenness all on Your shoulders
Your shoulders
[Chorus]
My help comes from You
You are my rest, my rescue
[Chorus]
I don't have to see to believe that 
You're lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders
