[Verse 1]
Oh I've heard a thousand stories of
What they think You're like
But I've heard the tender whisper of
Love in the dead of night
And You tell me that You're pleased
And that I'm never alone
[Chorus]
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am
[Verse 2]
Oh I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching
For answers only You provide
Cause You know just what we need, before we say a word
[Chorus]
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am
[Bridge]
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
To us
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways 
To us
[Verse 3]
Oh, it's love so undeniable
I, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable
I, I can hardly think
As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still
Into love, love, love
[Chorus]
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are
It's who You are
It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am
It's who I am
It's who I am
[Bridge]
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
To us
