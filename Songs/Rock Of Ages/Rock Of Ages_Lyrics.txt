Rock of Ages
CCLI license number: 15716492
[Verse 1]
Rock of ages cleft for me
Hide me now my refuge be

Let the water and the blood
From Your wounded side which flowed
Be for sin the double cure
Cleanse me from its guilt and power
[Verse 2]
Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Your lawâ€™s demands

Could my zeal no respite know
Could my tears forever flow
All for sin could not atone
You must save and You alone
[Verse 3]
Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to Your cross I cling

Naked come to You for dress
Helpless look to You for grace
Stained by sin to You I cry
Wash me Saviour or I die
[Verse 4]
While I draw this fleeting breath
When my eyelids close in death
When I soar through realms unknown
Bow before the judgement throne
Hide me then my refuge be
Rock of ages cleft for me-
When I soar through realms unknown
Bow before the judgement throne
Hide me then my refuge be
Rock of ages cleft for me
