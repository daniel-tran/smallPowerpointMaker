Captain
CCLI license number: 23847389
[VERSE 1]
Through waters uncharted my soul will embark
I’ll follow Your voice straight into the dark
And if from the course You intend I depart
Speak to the sails of my wandering heart
[Chorus]
Like the wind You’ll guide
Clear the skies before me
And I’ll glide this o - pen sea
Like the stars Your Word
Will align my voyage
And remind me where I’ve been
And where I am going
[Verse 2]
Lost in the shallows amidst fear and fog
Your truth is the compass that points me back north
Jesus, my Captain, my soul’s trusted Lord
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours
[Chorus]
Like the wind You’ll guide
Clear the skies before me
And I’ll glide this o - pen sea
Like the stars Your Word
Will align my voyage
And remind me where I’ve been
And where I am going
Like the wind You’ll guide
Clear the skies before me
And I’ll glide this o - pen sea
Like the stars Your Word
Will align my voyage
And remind me where I’ve been
And where I am going
