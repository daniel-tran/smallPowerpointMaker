I Will Boast in Christ (Live)
CCLI license number: 49555477
[Verse 1]
All I have because of Jesus
All this promise
Won for me
[Verse 1]
When He paid the highest ransom
Once for always
For my freedom
[Chorus]
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
[Chorus]
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
[Verse 2]
Love will never lose its power
All my failures
Could not erase
[Verse 2]
And now I walk within Your favour
Grace unending
My salvation
[Chorus]
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
[Chorus]
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
[Bridge 1]
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Bridge 2]
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Chorus]
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
[Chorus]
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
[Bridge]
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[Outro]
O precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
