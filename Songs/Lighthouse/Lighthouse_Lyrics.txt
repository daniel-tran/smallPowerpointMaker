My Lighthouse
CCLI license number: 42943337
[Verse 1]
In my wrestling and in my doubts
In my failures You won't walk out
[Verse 1]
Your great love will lead me through
You are the peace in my troubled sea
You are the peace in my troubled sea
[Verse 2]
In the silence, You won't let go
In my questions, Your truth will hold
[Verse 2]
Your great love will lead me through
You are the peace in my troubled sea
You are the peace in my troubled sea
[Chorus]
My lighthouse
My lighthouse
Shining in the darkness
I will follow You
My lighthouse
My lighthouse
I will trust the promise
You will carry me safe to shore
Safe to shore
Safe to shore
Safe to shore
[Verse 3]
I won't fear what tomorrow brings
With each morning I'll rise and sing
[Verse 3]
My God's love will lead me through
You are the peace in my troubled sea
You are the peace in my troubled sea
[Chorus]
My lighthouse
My lighthouse
Shining in the darkness
I will follow You
My lighthouse
My lighthouse
I will trust the promise
You will carry me safe to shore
Safe to shore
Safe to shore
Safe to shore
[Bridge]
Fire before us, You're the brightest
You will lead us through the storms (x4)
[Chorus]
My lighthouse
My lighthouse
Shining in the darkness
I will follow You
My lighthouse
My lighthouse
I will trust the promise
You will carry me safe to shore
Safe to shore
Safe to shore
Safe to shore
