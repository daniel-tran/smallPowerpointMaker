Who You Say I Am
CCLI license number: 32621306
[Verse 1]
Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
[Verse 1]
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me
[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
[Verse 2]
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
[Verse 2]
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me
[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
[Bridge]
I am chosen, not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me, not against me
I am who You say I am (x2)
I am who You say I am
[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
[Chorus ]
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
[Outro]
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
