Here I Am To Worship
CCLI license number: 20907020
[Verse 1]
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes and let me see
[Verse 1]
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You
[Chorus]
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
[Verse 2]
King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to this Earth You created
All for love's sake became poor
[Chorus]
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
[Bridge]
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin up on that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin up on that cross
[Chorus]
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
[Outro]
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
