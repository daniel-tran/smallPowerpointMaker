Be Thou My Vision (Ascend the hill)
CCLI license number: 26113155
[Verse 1]
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light
[Verse 2]
Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one
[Verse 3]
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always
Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art
[Chorus]
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied (x2)
[Post-Chorus]
My Jesus, you satisfy
My Jesus, you satisfy (x2)
[Verse 4]
High King of Heaven, my victory won
May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all
[Outro]
Oh, God, be my everything, be my delight
Be, Jesus, my glory My soul's satisfied (x2)
