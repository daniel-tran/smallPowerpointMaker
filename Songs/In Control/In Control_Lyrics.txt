[Verse 1]
From Heaven, You can hear
I know You're drawing near
As I worship
[Verse 1]
Held within Your love
The wind and waves will come
But I will stay here
[Chorus]
I lift my hands to Heaven
Here my heart surrendered
I tell my soul again
You are Lord of all
And though the seas are raging
You will speak and tame them
In You, I find my rest
You are in control
[Verse 2]
Through valleys, I will trust
Your spirit is enough, to keep me walking
You guide my every step
[Verse 2]
Speak life to me again
Lord, I need You
Oh I need You
[Chorus]
I lift my hands to Heaven
Here my heart surrendered
I tell my soul again
You are Lord of all
And though the seas are raging
You will speak and tame them
In You, I find my rest
You are in control
[Bridge]
I will trust in only You
No one can add to Your perfection
[Bridge]
You're the beginning and the end
More than I can comprehend
There is no one like You
No one
[Bridge]
I will trust in only You
No one can add to Your perfection
[Bridge]
You're the beginning and the end
More than I can comprehend
There is no one like You
No one
[Bridge]
I will trust in only You
No one can add to Your perfection
[Bridge]
You're the beginning and the end
More than I can comprehend
There is no one like You
No one
[Chorus]
I lift my hands to Heaven
Here my heart surrendered
I tell my soul again
You are Lord of all
And though the seas are raging
You will speak and tame them
In You, I find my rest
You are in control
I lift my hands to Heaven
Here my heart surrendered
I tell my soul again
You are Lord of all
And though the seas are raging
You will speak and tame them
In You, I find my rest
You are in control
[Outro]
In You, I find my rest
You are in control
