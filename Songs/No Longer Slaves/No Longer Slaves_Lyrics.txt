No Longer Slaves
CCLI license number: 61097800
[Verse 1]
You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone
[Chorus]
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God (x2)
[Verse 2]
From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name

I’ve been born again
Into a family
Your blood flows through my veins
[Chorus]
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God (x4)
[Interlude]
I am surrounded
By the arms of the father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance
We've been liberated
From our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom
[Interlude]
Oh-oh
oh-oh-oh (x3)
[Bridge]
You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love

You rescued me
And I will stand and sing
I am a child of God

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
You drowned my fears in perfect love

You rescued me
And I will stand and sing
I am a child of God (last line x6)
[Chorus]
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God (x2)
