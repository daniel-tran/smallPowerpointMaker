Cornerstone (Live)
CCLI license number: 45411021
[Verse 1]
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus name (x2)
[Chorus]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
[Verse 2]
When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
[Verse 2]
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
My anchor holds within the veil
[Chorus]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
[Post chorus]
He is Lord, Lord of all
[Chorus]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
[Verse 3]
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before the throne
[Chorus]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[Chorus]
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
He is Lord, Lord of all
[Chorus]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[Chorus]
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
He is Lord, Lord of all
