From the Inside Out

[Verse 1]
A thousand times I've failed
Still Your Mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in Your Grace
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
[Verse 2]
Your Will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
[Refrain]
In my heart, in my soul
I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
[Refrain]
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out
[Verse 3]
Your Will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
[Refrain]
In my heart, in my soul
I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
[Refrain]
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out
[Chorus]
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out
[Instrumental]
[Refrain]
In my heart, in my soul
I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
[Refrain]
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out

Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades

Your Glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out, Lord, my soul cries out
From the inside out, Lord, my soul cries out
