The Heart of Worship
CCLI license number: 10314808
[Verse 1]
When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
[Verse 1]
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
[Pre-Chorus]
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
[Chorus]
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
[Verse 2]
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
[Verse 2]
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
[Pre-Chorus]
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
[Chorus 1]
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
[Chorus 2]
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus
[Outro]
I'll bring you more than a song
I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song

I'll bring you more than a song
I'll bring you more than a song
More than a song

You're looking into my heart, 
looking into my heart
You're looking into my heart

You're looking into my heart, 
looking into my heart
You're looking into my heart
