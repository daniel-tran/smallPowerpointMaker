One Way
CCLI license number: 13293545
[Verse 1]
I lay my life down at Your feet
'Cause You're the only One I need
I turn to You and You are always there

In troubled times it's You I seek
I put You first that's all I need
I humble all I am all to You
[Chorus]
One way, Jesus
You're the only One that I could live for
One way, Jesus
You're the only One that I could live for
[Verse 2]
You are always always there
Every how and every where
Your grace abounds so deeply within me

You will never ever change
Yesterday today the same
Forever 'til forever meets no end
[Chorus]
One way, Jesus
You're the only One that I could live for
One way, Jesus
You're the only One that I could live for (x2)
[Bridge]
You are the Way, the Truth and the Life
We live by faith and not by sight for You
We're living all for You (x4)
[Chorus]
One way, Jesus
You're the only One that I could live for
One way, Jesus
You're the only One that I could live for (x2)
