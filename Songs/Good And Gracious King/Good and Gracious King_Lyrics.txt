Good and Gracious King
CCLI license number: 44439016
[Verse 1]
I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring
But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King
[Verse 2]
I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength
Come and fill me with Your Spirit
As I sing to You this praise
[Chorus]
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing
Empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome with joy I sing
By Your love I am accepted
You’re a good and gracious King
[Verse 3]
O what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend
Safe, secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again
[Chorus]
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing
Empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome with joy I sing
By Your love I am accepted
You’re a good and gracious King
[Bridge]
Holy, holy, Lord Almighty
Good and gracious
Good and gracious

Holy, holy, Lord Almighty
Good and gracious King


Holy, holy, Lord Almighty
Good and gracious
Good and gracious

Holy, holy, Lord Almighty
Good and gracious King


[Chorus]
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing
Empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory
Overcome with joy I sing
By Your love I am accepted
You’re a good and gracious King
