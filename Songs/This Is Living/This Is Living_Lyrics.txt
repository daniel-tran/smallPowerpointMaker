This Is Living
CCLI license number: 23847389
[Verse 1]
Waking up knowing there's a reason
All my dreams come alive
Life is for living with You
I've made my decision
[Verse 2]
Verse2
You lift me up, fill my eyes with wonder
Forever young in Your love
This freedom's untainted with You
No moment is wasted
[Pre-chorus]
See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turns to colour all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found

[Chorus]
This is living now
This is living now


You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God, Your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more
[Verse 3]
You lead the way, God You're right beside me
In Your love I'm complete
There's nothing like living with You
This life You created I choose
[Pre-chorus]
See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turns to colour all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found

[Chorus]
This is living now
This is living now


You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God, Your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more
