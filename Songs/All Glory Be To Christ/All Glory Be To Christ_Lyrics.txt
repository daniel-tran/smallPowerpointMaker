All Glory Be to Christ
Public domain
[Verse 1]
Should nothing of our efforts stand
No legacy survive
Unless the Lord does raise the house
In vain its builders strive
[Bridge]
To you who boast tomorrow's gain
Tell me, what is your life?
A mist that vanishes at dawn
All glory be to Christ
[Chorus]
All glory be to Christ our king
All glory be to Christ
His rule and reign we'll ever sing
All glory be to Christ
[Verse 2]
His will be done, His kingdom come
On earth as is above
Who is Himself our daily bread
Praise Him, the Lord of love
[Bridge]
Let living water satisfy
The thirsty without price
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
All glory be to Christ
[Chorus]
All glory be to Christ our king
All glory be to Christ
His rule and reign we'll ever sing
All glory be to Christ
[Verse 3]
When on the day the great I am
The faithful and the true
The Lamb, who was for sinners, slain
Is making all things new
Behold our God shall live with us
And be our steadfast light
And we shall e'er his people be
All glory be to Christ
[Chorus]
All glory be to Christ our king
All glory be to Christ
His rule and reign we'll ever sing
All glory be to Christ
