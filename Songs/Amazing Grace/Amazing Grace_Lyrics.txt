Amazing Grace
Public domain
[Verse 1]
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind but now I see
[Verse 2]
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
[Verse 3]
The Lord hath promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
[Verse 4]
When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.
