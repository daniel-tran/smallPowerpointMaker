Lord I Offer My Life

[Chorus]
Lord, I offer my life to you
Everything I've been through
Use it for your glory

Lord I offer my days to you
Lifting my praise to you
As a pleasing sacrifice
Lord I offer you my life
[Verse 2]
Things in the past, things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
All of my heart, all of my praise
My heart and my hands are lifted to you
[Chorus]
Lord, I offer my life to you
Everything I've been through
Use it for your glory

Lord I offer my days to you
Lifting my praise to you
As a pleasing sacrifice
[Bridge]
What can we give
That you have not given?
And what do we have
That is not already yours?
All we possess
Are these lives we're living
That's what we give to you, Lord
[Chorus]
Lord, I offer my life to you
Everything I've been through
Use it for your glory

Lord I offer my days to you
Lifting my praise to you
As a pleasing sacrifice
[Chorus]
Lord, I offer my life to you
Everything I've been through
Use it for your glory

Lord I offer my days to you
Lifting my praise to you
As a pleasing sacrifice
