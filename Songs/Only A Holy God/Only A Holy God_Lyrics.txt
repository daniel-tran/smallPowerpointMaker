Only a Holy God
CCLI license number: 26707999
[Verse 1]
Who else commands all the hosts of Heaven?
Who else could make every king bow down?
Who else could whisper and darkness trembles?
Only a Holy God
[Verse 2]
What other beauty demands such praises?
What other splendour outshines the Sun?
What other majesty rules with justice?
Only a Holy God
[Chorus]
Come and behold Him, the One and the Only
Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God
[Verse 3]
What other glory consumes like fire?
What other power can raise the dead?
And what other name remains undefeated?
Only a Holy God
[Chorus]
Come and behold Him, the One and the Only
Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God (x2)
[Verse 4]
Who else could rescue me from my failing?
Who else would offer His only Son?
And who else invites me to call Him Father?
Only a Holy God, Only my Holy God
[Chorus]
Come and behold Him, the One and the Only
Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God (x2)
