God So Loved (Live)
CCLI license number: 44439016
[Chorus]
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes will not perish
They shall have eternal life
[Verse 1]
I shall hold to the cross
I shall hold to God alone
For His love has salvaged me
For His love has set me free
[Chorus]
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes will not perish
They shall have eternal life
[Verse 2]
I shall wait upon the Lord
I shall wait upon His word
And by His grace, I am released
And by His grace, I am redeemed
[Chorus]
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes will not perish
They shall have eternal life
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
And by His precious blood, I have been set free
For the glory of Jesus' name
I surrender all, now to Christ alone
In Jesus, I am saved
By His precious blood, I have been set free
For the glory of Jesus' name
I surrender all, now to Christ alone
In Jesus, I am saved
[Chorus]
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes will not perish
They shall have eternal life
Yes, they shall have eternal life
