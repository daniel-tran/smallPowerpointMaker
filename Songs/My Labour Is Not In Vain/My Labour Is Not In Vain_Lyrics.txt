My Labour Is Not In Vain
CCLI license number: 7253280
[Verse 1]
My work in Christ is not in vain
My labor will not fail
For when I toil in Jesus’ name
His purpose will prevail
[Verse 2]
The tasks that You have set for me
I may not understand
Yet I will follow where You lead
I trust Your sovereign hand
[Chorus]
So may all I do, be it great or small
Bring glory to Your name
[Chorus]
In Your grace alone I will car – ry on
Your promise to me remains
My labour is not in vain
[Verse 3]
Go forth, You said, take up your cross
And set the captive free
So give me feet to seek the lost
Just as You searched for me
[Chorus]
So may all I do, be it great or small
Bring glory to Your name
[Chorus]
In Your grace alone I will car – ry on
Your promise to me remains
My labour is not in vain
[Verse 4]
Take heart, my soul, and persevere
Just as your Saviour did
For soon you will be home at rest
Your work, complete in Him
[Chrous]
So may all I do, be it great or small
Bring glory to Your name
[Chrous]
In Your grace alone I will car – ry on
Your promise to me remains
My labour is not in vain
[Chrous]
So may all I do, be it great or small
Bring glory to Your name
[Chrous]
In Your grace alone I will car – ry on
Your promise to me remains
My labour is not in vain
