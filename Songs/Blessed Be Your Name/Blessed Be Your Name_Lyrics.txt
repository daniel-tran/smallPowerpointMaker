[Verse 1]
Blessed be Your name
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name
[Verse 2]
Blessed be Your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name
[Pre-Chorus]
Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say
[Chorus]
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name
[Verse 3]
Blessed be Your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be Your name
[Verse 4]
Blessed be Your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name
[Pre-Chorus]
Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
And when the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say
[Chorus]
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name
[Chorus 2]
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name
[Bridge]
You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Blessed be Your name (x3)
[Chorus]
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name (x2)
