A Thousand Hallelujahs (Live)
CCLI license number: 92406706
[Verse 1]
Who else would rocks cry out to worship?
Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine
[Chorus]
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
[Verse 2]
Who else would die for our redemption?
Whose resurrection means I’ll rise?
There isn’t time enough to sing of all You’ve done
But I have eternity to try
[Chorus]
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
[Bridge]
Praise to the Lord
To the lamb
To the King of Heaven
[Bridge]
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever
[Bridge]
Praise to the Lord
To the lamb
To the King of Heaven
[Bridge]
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever
[Chorus]
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
[Bridge]
Praise to the Lord
To the lamb
To the King of Heaven
[Bridge]
Praise for He rose
Now He reigns
We will sing forever
[Chorus]
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
