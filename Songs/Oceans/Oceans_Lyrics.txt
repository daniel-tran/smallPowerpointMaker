Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)
CCLI license number: 67142105
[Verse 1]
You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown, where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep, my faith will stand
[Chorus]
And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
[Verse 2]
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now
[Chorus]
So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
[Bridge]
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
[Bridge]
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour
[Bridge]
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
[Bridge]
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour
[Bridge]
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
[Bridge]
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour
[Chorus]
And I will call upon Your name
And Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine
