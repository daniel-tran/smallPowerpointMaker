Man of Sorrows
CCLI license number: 46786301
[Verse 1]
Man of Sorrows, Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of men and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid
[Verse 2]
Silent as He stood accused
Beaten, mocked, and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns
[Chorus]
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee
[Verse 3]
Sent of heaven, God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree
[Chorus]
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee
[Bridge]
Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed! (x2)
[Chorus]
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee
[Verse 4]
See, the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah, God be praised
He's risen from the grave!
[Chorus]
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee
[Outro]
Praise and honour unto Thee
