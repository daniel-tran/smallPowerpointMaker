Reckless Love
CCLI license number: 84893008
[Verse 1]
Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me
[Chorus]
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it,
Still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God
[Verse 2]
When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me
[Chorus]
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it,
Still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God
[Bridge]
There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
[Bridge]
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me
[Bridge]
There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
[Bridge]
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me
[Bridge]
There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
[Bridge]
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me
[Bridge]
There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
[Bridge]
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me
[Chorus]
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, 
Reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found
Leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it,
Still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending
Reckless love of God
