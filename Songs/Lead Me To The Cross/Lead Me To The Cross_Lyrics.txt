Lead Me to the Cross
CCLI license number: 40892093
[Verse 1]
Savior I come
Quiet my soul
Remember

Redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss
[Chorus]
Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me
Lead me to the cross
[Verse 2]
You were as I
Tempted and trialled
Human

The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now You're risen
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss
[Chorus]
Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me
Lead me to the cross
[Bridge]
To Your heart
To Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
Lead me to Your heart
[Chorus]
Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me, lead me

Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me
Lead me to the cross
