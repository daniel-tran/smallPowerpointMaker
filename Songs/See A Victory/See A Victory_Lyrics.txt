See A Victory
CCLI license number: 42167984
[Verse 1]
The weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper
When the darkness falls, it won't prevail
'Cause the God I serve knows only how to triumph
My God will never fail, my God will never fail
[Chorus]
I'm gonna see a victory
I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You, Lord (x2)
[Verse 2]
There's power in the mighty name of Jesus
Every war He wages He will win
I'm not backing down from any giant
'Cause I know how this story ends
Yes, I know how this story ends
[Chorus]
I'm gonna see a victory
I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You, Lord (x4)
[Bridge]
You take what the enemy meant for evil
And You turn it for good
You turn it for good (x6)
[Chorus]
I'm gonna see a victory
I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You, Lord (x4)
[Outro]
You take what the enemy meant for evil
And You turn it for good
You turn it for good (x2)
