[Chorus]
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
[Chorus]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name
[Verse 1]
The sun comes up
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
[Verse 1]
Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me
Let me be singing
When the evening comes
[Chorus]
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
[Chorus]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name
[Verse 2]
You're rich in love
And You're slow to anger
Your name is great
And Your heart is kind
[Verse 2]
For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find
[Chorus]
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
[Chorus]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name
[Verse 3]
And on that day
When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come
[Verse 3]
Still my soul will
Sing Your praise unending
[Verse 3]
Ten thousand years
And then forevermore
Forevermore
[Chorus]
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
[Chorus]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I’ll worship your holy name 
[Chorus]
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
[Chorus]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I’ll worship your holy name
[Tag]
Lord I’ll worship your holy name
I’ll worship your holy name
[Outro]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name
I'll worship Your Holy name
