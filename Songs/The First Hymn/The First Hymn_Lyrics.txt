The First Hymn
CCLI license number: 90900446
[Verse]
Let all be silent
The shining stars not sound
Rushing rivers still
Let the mountains bow down
In awe and wonder
In reverence we come
Who is worthy of all worship?
Who is seated on the throne?
[Chorus]
All powers cry out in answer
All glory and praise forever
To our God
The Father, Son and Holy Spirit
Amen, we sing, amen

Who is seated on the throne?
