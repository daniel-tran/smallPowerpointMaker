Hosanna
CCLI license number: 52593602
[Verse 1]
I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes yeah
[Verse 2]
I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing
[Chorus]
Hosanna hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
[Verse 3]
I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith
[Verse 4]
I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees
[Chorus]
Hosanna hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
[Bridge]
Heal my hеart and make it clean
Open up my еyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me
[Bridge]
Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity
[Chorus]
Hosanna hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
