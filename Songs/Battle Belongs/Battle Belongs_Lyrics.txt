[Verse 1]
When all I see is the battle
You see my victory
When all I see is the mountain
You see a mountain moved
And as I walk through the shadow
Your love surrounds me
There's nothing to fear now
for I am safe with You
[Chorus]
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
[Chorus]
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
[Verse 2]
And if You are for me, who can be against me?
For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for You
When all I see are the ashes, You see the beauty
When all I see is a cross, God, You see the empty tomb
[Chorus]
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
[Chorus]
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
[Bridge]
Almighty fortress, You go before us
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
You shine in the shadow, You win every battle
Nothing can stand against the power of our God (x3)
[Chorus]
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
[Chorus]
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
