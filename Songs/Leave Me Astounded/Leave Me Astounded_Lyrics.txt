Leave Me Astounded
CCLI license number: 75328290
[Verse 1]
All my hands have made I'm laying down
All that I hold dear, my many crowns
I've tasted and seen of Your great love
You satisfy me, you satisfy me
[Chorus]
Spirit fall, open up heaven's doors
We're waiting with worship for more
You're the only love that satisfies me
[Verse 2]
My constant request above all things
Every hour I wake, be near me
Though I've tasted and seen of Your great love

Show me Your glory
Show me Your glory
[Chorus]
Spirit fall, open up heaven's doors
We're waiting with worship for morе
You're the only love that satisfiеs me

Lord, we run into Your loving arms
We're safe and secure in Your love
You're the only love that satisfies me
[Bridge]
Leave me astounded, leave me amazed
Show off Your glory, let heaven invade
We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise
For the almighty presence of God to invade (x2)
[Chorus]
Spirit fall, open up heaven's doors
We're waiting with worship for more
You're the only love that satisfies me

Lord, we run into Your loving arms
We're safe and secure in Your love
You're the only love that satisfies me
[Bridge]
Leave me astounded, leave me amazed
Show off Your glory, let heaven invade
We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise
For the almighty presence of God to invade (x2)
