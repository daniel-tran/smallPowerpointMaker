Remembrance (Live)
CCLI license number: 54982882
[Verse 1]
I take the bread of life
Broken for all my sin
Your body crucified
To make me whole again
[Verse 2]
I will recall the cup
Poured out in sacrifice
To trade this sinner's end
For Your new covenant
[Chorus]
Hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance
Hallelujah
Your promise I won't forget
[Verse 3]
I'll walk salvation's road
With fear and trembling
Your way borne as my own
As Christ is formed in me
[Chorus]
Hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance
Hallelujah
Your promise I won't forget
[Post-Chorus]
If ever I should lose my way
If ever I deny Your grace
Remind me of the price You paid

Hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance
[Bridge]
You've been so, so good to me
You've been so, so good to me
Oh to think where I would be
If not for You, if not for You (x3)
[Post-Chorus 2]
As far as heights reach from the depths
As far as east is from the west
So far Your grace has carried me
[Post-Chorus 3]
Until I see You face to face
Until at last I've won my race
Remind me You're not finished yet
[Outro]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance
