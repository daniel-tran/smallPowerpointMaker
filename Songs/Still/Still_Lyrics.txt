Still
CCLI license number: 90900446
[Verse 1]
Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand
[Chorus]
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God
[Verse 2]
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust
[Chorus]
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God (x2)
[Verse 3]
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust
[Chorus]
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
And I will be still, know You are God (x2)
[Outro]
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God
