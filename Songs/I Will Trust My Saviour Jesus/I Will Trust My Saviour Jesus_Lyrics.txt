CCLI license number: 14548137
[Verse 1]
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
When my darkest doubts befall
Trust Him when to simply trust Him
Seems the hardest thing of all
[Verse 2]
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
Trust Him when my strength is small
For I know the shield of Jesus
Is the safest place of all
[Chorus]
Jesus, only Jesus
Help me trust You more and more
Jesus, only Jesus
May my heart be ever Yours
[Verse 3]
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
He has said His way is best
And I know the path He's chosen
Leads to everlasting rest
[Chorus]
Jesus, only Jesus
Help me trust You more and more
Jesus, only Jesus
May my heart be ever Yours (x2)
[Bridge]
Oh on that cross, how it was seen
I can go now ever trusting in the One who died for me
[Bridge]
What could I bring for Your gift is complete
So I trust You, simply trust You, Lord,
With every part of me
[Bridge]
Oh on that cross, how it was seen
I can go now ever trusting in the One who died for me
[Bridge]
What could I bring for Your gift is complete
So I trust You, simply trust You, Lord,
With every part of me
[Bridge]
Oh on that cross, how it was seen
I can go now ever trusting in the One who died for me
[Bridge]
What could I bring for Your gift is complete
So I trust You, simply trust You, Lord,
With every part of me
[Chorus]
Jesus, only Jesus
Help me trust You more and more
Jesus, only Jesus
May my heart be ever Yours (x2)
