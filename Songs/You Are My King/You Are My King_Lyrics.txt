[Verse 1]
I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
And I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again (x2)
[Chorus]
Amazing love, how can it be
That You, my King, should die for me?
Amazing love, I know it's true
And it's my joy to honor You
In all I do, to honor You
[Verse 2]
I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again
[Chorus]
Amazing love, how can it be
That You, my King, should die for me?
Amazing love, I know it's true
It's my joy to honor You
[Bridge]
In all I do, to honor You
In all I do, to honor You
You are my King
You are my King
Jesus, You are my King
You are my King
[Chorus]
Amazing love, how can it be
That You, my King, should die for me?
Amazing love, I know it's true
It's my joy to honor You
Amazing love, how can it be
That You, my King, should die for me?
Amazing love, I know it's true
And it's my joy to honor You

In all I do, to honor You
In all I do, to honor You
In all I do, let me honor You
