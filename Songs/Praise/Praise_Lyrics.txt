Praise
CCLI license number: 58705354
[Verse 1]
I'll praise in the valley, praise on the mountain
I'll praise when I'm sure, praise when I'm doubting
I'll praise when outnumbered, praise when surrounded
'Cause praise is the waters my enemies drown in
[Chorus]
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
[Verse 2]
I'll praise when I feel it, and I'll praise when I don’t
I'll praise 'cause I know You’re still in control
'Cause my praise is a weapon, it's more than a sound
Oh, my praise is the shout that brings Jericho down
[Chorus]
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
So how could I keep it inside?
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
[Bridge]
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign,
Praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave

I'll praise 'cause You're faithful,
Praise 'cause You’re true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You

I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign,
Praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave

I'll praise 'cause You're faithful,
Praise 'cause You’re true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You
[Chorus]
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
