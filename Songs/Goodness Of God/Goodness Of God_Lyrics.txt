[Verse 1]
I love You, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been held in Your hands
[Verse 1]
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
[Chorus]
All my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
[Verse 2]
I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
And in darkest night You are close like no other
[Verse 2]
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God
[Chorus]
All my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
[Bridge]
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
[Bridge]
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
[Bridge]
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
[Bridge]
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
[Chorus]
All my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
All my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
